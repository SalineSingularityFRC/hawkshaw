HAWKSHAW
	A parts tracker designed for the Saline Singularity FRC team.

BUILDING
	This is written in PHP, and tested on Ubuntu with PHP7.

	For this to do anything, you'll need to populate a `data.json` file,
	which will serve as the "database".

	Once you have a data file, it should be able to start with a simple
	% php -S 0.0.0.0:80
	Which will start the server at your IP on port 80.

CONTACT / BUGS
	To submit a git patch or file an issue, please send an email to Skylar
	Bleed at skylarbleed@protonmail.ch. Patches welcome and encouraged! (I
	do not know how to write PHP so I'll take all the help I can get).
